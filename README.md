# Simulation for ATM using cpp languages üèß
## Personal project initial code programing languages 
---

This project was carried out as an assignment for the programming subject in order to learn how to handle different types of validations and the use of loops that serve to maintain control of programs that require this type of reasoning, taking into account a user experience that helps users stay alert to the data entered into the program.

In this section, the standard outputs that the program can have will be shown for its simple and educational use. No graphical interface libraries are used to keep the program usage simple.
